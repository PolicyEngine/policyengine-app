We used Claude Code to choose our DC office.

Built an interactive comparison tool ‚Üí analyzed 8 coworking spaces ‚Üí picked the Open Gov Hub.

Now we're surrounded by 40+ civic tech and policy organizations in the heart of DC üßµ

How did we decide? We turned office hunting into a software project.

Built an interactive comparison tool with Claude Code to evaluate 8 DC coworking spaces - with real commute calculations using the Google Maps API.

The PolicyEngine DC team at our new home: the Open Gov Hub!

How we chose it: turned office hunting into a software project with Claude Code üßµ

The microsite calculated actual transit times from our team locations using the Google Maps API.

Transformed "centrally located" claims into objective data we could compare.

Funny quirk: Claude Code (Opus 4.1) developed a strong preference for Open Gov Hub. Had to explicitly request more objective analysis.

The newer Sonnet 4.5 shows less of this behavior.

**Text:**
```
When faced with choosing a DC office, we asked: why not turn this into a software project?

Using Claude Code, we built an interactive comparison tool that:
‚Ä¢ Evaluated 8 DC coworking spaces across multiple criteria
‚Ä¢ Integrated the Google Maps API for real commute time calculations from our team's locations
‚Ä¢ Provided structured data analysis instead of subjective notes

The winner: Open Gov Hub - home to 40+ civic tech and policy organizations, with the practical advantages we needed (central location, competitive pricing, global network access).

Key insight: When you frame any decision as a software project, AI coding agents can bring systematic analysis and creative solutions you might not have considered.
