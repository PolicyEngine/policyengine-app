    "On Wednesday, 6 March, Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt will present the government's 2024 Spring Budget. Though the specific budgetary provisions Number 11 will put forth remain private, various sources speculate that the chancellor will cut the National Insurance rate, a supplement to his previous cuts in autumn 2023 (analysed by PolicyEngine in [this article](https://policyengine.org/uk/research/autumn-statement-2023)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we'll estimate the impacts of such a cut upon the budget, as well as upon society-wide economic performance indicators. We'll also look at the impact these changes would have upon an average UK household.\n",

    "# Reforms within Spring Budget 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "News media speculation regarding the Spring Budget's proposed reforms has mooted changes to various different tax provisions. In this article, we will utilise PolicyEngine to model and analyse three:\n",
    "* Cuts to Employee (Class 1) National Insurance Contributions (NICs) by either 1p or 2p, depending upon the source[^1][^3]\n",
    "* A 2p cut to the basic rate of tax, lowering the rate from 20p to 18p[^4]\n",
    "* A fuel duty freeze[^1]\n",
    "\n",
    "In modelling these reforms, we will assume each took effect on 1 January 2024 and will evaluate their impacts over calendar year 2024. In the future, PolicyEngine hopes to develop the capability to accurately model the true effective date of these sorts of policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "# NIC Cuts\n",
    "Turning first to the macro impacts, the PolicyEngine model projects that a reduction in the Class 1 NIC contribution rate by 2p costs the government approximately Â£10 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "[chart]\n",
    "\n",
    "Under such a reform, every income decile stands to gain financially, with 62p of households increasing their post-tax income, and none seeing a decrease in take-home pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "[chart]\n",
    "\n",
    "While every income decile stands to gain, top earners do especially well, meaning that the NIC contribution reform generates an ambiguous effect upon income inequality - while the top 1% of the population's share of wealth decreases, the GINI income inequality coefficient actually increases. The poverty rate would also be projected to decrease, but quite modestly (0.1 percentage points, or 0.3p against its current rate).\n",
