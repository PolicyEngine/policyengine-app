    "PolicyEngine's free and open-source microsimulation model estimates the budgetary, distributional and poverty impacts of UK tax and benefit reforms by simulating the full details of policy over a large representative dataset of UK households. In this post, we'll provide a brief overview of how PolicyEngine UK's microsimulation model works, and an update on how we maintain and validate the model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model overview\n",
    "\n",
    "PolicyEngine UK is a *static* microsimulation model- it does not (yet) incorporate behavioural responses like labour supply reactions to policy changes. Instead, we assume that households do not change their behaviour in response to policy changes, and that the only way that policy changes affect households is through their direct effects on household incomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the direct effects of policy changes, we apply the actual policy rules as specified in legislation to each of a large (tens of thousands) survey of UK households. We can then change the rules, and see how the totals of different variables change. For example, we could change the personal tax allowance from £12,570 to £15,000 and aggregate the tax payments before and after the policy change to estimate how much more tax is collected from the households in our survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is written in Python, and you can follow all of our real-time development [on GitHub](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/PolicyEngine-UK). Other models exists maintained by other organisations which use the same microsimulation approach: the IFS' TAXBEN, UKMOD at the University of Essex, and, the IPPR model, and internal models at HMRC and DWP. However, only PolicyEngine UK and UKMOD publish their policy implementation details and validation statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How PolicyEngine differs from other models\n",
    "\n",
    "PolicyEngine's core approach to estimate policy impacts is the same as other static microsimulation models. However, we use a novel data science-based approach to improve the accuracy of the model's outputs significantly compared to other models (where we have been able to compare).\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsimulation models are widely used by researchers to estimate policy impacts (questions for which we don't know the answer). But when we attempt to validate the models by asking them questions for which we do know the answer (for example, total Income Tax revenue in 2021), we often find that the model answers are significantly different from the ground truth. This problem is large and *exists in every microsimulation model that publishes details of attempts to measure it*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that the policy implementations in the model are correct (while the law is complex and we cannot test every possible household, we publish and meet hundreds of automated tests on every version update), the most likely explanation for this is that the model's survey data is not representative of the population: the model's outputs are only as good as the data that we feed into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have adopted an approach to reduce this problem by using machine learning techniques to improve the survey's accuracy by using data from other trusted sources: OBR, HMRC, DWP, ONS and others. We essentially do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take the initial survey data\n",
    "2. Add synthetic households (using other microdata) and previous-year households with zero weight\n",
    "3. Collect trusted external statistics describing tax-benefit and demographic properties of the UK\n",
    "4. Train a machine learning model adjust the weights of the survey to best fit those external statistics\n",
