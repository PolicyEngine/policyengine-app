Today, the Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt will deliver the annual [Autumn Statement](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/what-is-the-autumn-statement/), widely expected to include policy reforms to both taxes and benefits. Yesterday evening, the Times [reported](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/national-living-wage-rise-jeremy-hunt-autumn-statement-j9f0pssxw) that these reforms will specifically include:

* A 1p cut to the main rates of National Insurance
* A 6.7% increase in non-State Pension benefit payment levels
* An 8.5% increase in the State Pension payment level

Previous reports have suggested alternative reforms to be under consideration:

* A 1p cut to the basic rate of Income Tax by [the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/aafea716-30d5-4518-98fe-169f6995173e)
* A less-than-inflation increase in payment levels by [Christians against Poverty](https://capuk.org/news-and-blog/what-will-be-in-the-autumn-statement), [among others](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/15/jeremy-hunt-urged-not-to-use-sharp-fall-in-inflation-to-squeeze-benefits)
* Cuts to Stamp Duty and Inheritance tax by [The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/autumn-statement-2023-predictions-jeremy-hunt-budget-tax-cuts-03sms6x82)

In this post, we'll delve into PolicyEngine's budgetary, distributional and poverty impacts for these proposed tax and benefit modifications, examining them both as standalone measures and as a combined reform.


## Tax cuts

PolicyEngine estimates the reform outlined in the Times report, lowering the main Class 1 and Class 4 National Insurance rates by 1p, would cost £5.1 billion in the first year. The bottom decile sees an average gain of £3, while the fifth decile and the top decile see higher average gains of £150 and £501 respectively.

This reform benefits 65% of the population[^1]. Higher-income households are more likely to gain disposable income: around 90% of the top three deciles benefit, compared to around 30% of the bottom three.

[^1]: By 'benefits', we mean that the individual's household's disposable income increases as a result of the reform. For example, children not in work benefit from the reform if their parents' disposable income increases.
