Today, the Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt will deliver the annual [Autumn Statement](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/what-is-the-autumn-statement/), widely expected to include policy reforms to both taxes and benefits. Yesterday evening, the Times [reported](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/national-living-wage-rise-jeremy-hunt-autumn-statement-j9f0pssxw) that these reforms will specifically include:

* A 1p cut to the main rates of National Insurance
* A 6.7% increase in non-State Pension benefit payment levels
* An 8.5% increase in the State Pension payment level

Previous reports have suggested alternative reforms to be under consideration:

* A 1p cut to the basic rate of Income Tax ([the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/aafea716-30d5-4518-98fe-169f6995173e))
* A less-than-inflation increase in benefit payment levels ([Christians against Poverty](https://capuk.org/news-and-blog/what-will-be-in-the-autumn-statement) and [others](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/15/jeremy-hunt-urged-not-to-use-sharp-fall-in-inflation-to-squeeze-benefits))
* Cuts to Stamp Duty and Inheritance tax ([The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/autumn-statement-2023-predictions-jeremy-hunt-budget-tax-cuts-03sms6x82))

In this post, we'll delve into PolicyEngine's budgetary, distributional and poverty impacts for these proposed tax and benefit modifications, examining them both as standalone measures and as a combined reform.

## National Insurance cuts

The Times reported that Hunt would lower the main Class 1 and Class 4 National Insurance rates by 1p, from 12p to 11p and from 9p to 8p, respectively.

### Household impact

For a [single person with only employment income](https://policyengine.org/uk/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=37170&region=uk&timePeriod=2023&baseline=1&household=32608), this reform produces a benefit if they earn at least £12,570. It would produce the maximum benefit of £377 if they earn at least £50,500.

### Societal impact

Our microsimulation model projects that this NI cut will [cost £5.1 billion](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=37170&region=uk&timePeriod=2023&baseline=1) in the first year. Households in the bottom income decile would [gain an average of £3](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&reform=37170&region=uk&timePeriod=2023&baseline=1), while those in the top decile would gain an average of £501.

As a result of the reform, [65% of the population](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=37170&region=uk&timePeriod=2023&baseline=1) would see their household net income rise, disproportionately those in higher-income households: around 90% of the top three deciles benefit, compared to around 30% of the bottom three.

![Figure 3: Percentage of households gaining from cutting 1p from NI rates, by income decile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35577657/284752238-d29e939a-c5e9-4bc4-a712-3a6522833160.png)

The reform has a [small, ambiguous effect on income inequality](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=37170&region=uk&timePeriod=2023&baseline=1): while the Gini index rises by 0.2%, the top 1% share of income falls by 0.1%. Absolute, before-housing-costs [poverty falls by 0.3%](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=37170&region=uk&timePeriod=2023&baseline=1), or around 60,000 individuals.

## Benefit increases

The Times reported that Hunt will increase benefits in accordance with separate uprating norms:

* The State Pension will rise by 8.5%, the pace of earnings growth. State Pension is uprated by the triple lock, which guarantees that the payment level increases by the highest of inflation, average earnings growth, or 2.5%.
* Non-State Pension benefits will rise by 6.7%, the inflation rate as measured by the difference in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from September 2022 to September 2023.

This section compares these combined reforms against a counterfactual where benefits are not uprated at all.

### Household impact

For a [single person](https://policyengine.org/uk/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=37185&region=uk&timePeriod=2023&baseline=1&household=32608), benefit uprating raises net income by the maximum of £279 if they have no earnings. If they earn at least £7,500, the benefit of uprating is reduced to £10, where it remains.

![Figure 4: Impact of benefit uprating on a single person](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6076111/284802619-1be7078f-6383-49b4-a351-bf566befa47a.png)

A [family of four](https://policyengine.org/uk/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=37185&region=uk&timePeriod=2023&baseline=1&household=35960) (two adults and two children) will gain the maximum of £989 until they earn about £6,500, at which point it falls to £136 at £38,000 earnings.

![Figure 5: Impact of benefit uprating on a family of four](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6076111/284803407-bd64312d-a0a0-4a1c-94b6-8181953512f0.png)

Finally, a [couple of pension age](https://policyengine.org/uk/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=37185&region=uk&timePeriod=2023&baseline=1&household=35963) will gain the maximum of £981, falling to £10 at £17,500 earnings.

### Societal impact

Compared to not uprating benefits at all, we estimate that these increases combined would cost [£7.2 billion](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=37191&region=uk&timePeriod=2023&baseline=1) and [£9.6 billion](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=37181&region=uk&timePeriod=2023&baseline=1) in the first year, respectively. Together, they would cost [£16.7 billion](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.detailedBudgetaryImpact&reform=37185&region=uk&timePeriod=2023&baseline=1).

These reforms benefit the lowest income deciles the most: the bottom decile sees an average gain of over 5%, while the top decile sees a gain of 0.3%.

![Figure 7: Relative impact by income decile of increasing the State Pension by 8.5% and non-State Pension benefits by 6.7%](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35577657/284753381-e9f211ac-4309-454a-8586-16dd892430ef.png)

Due to the minimum benefit [say more], [96% of the population gains](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=37185&region=uk&timePeriod=2023&baseline=1) from benefit uprating, including 32% who gain at least 5% of their net income. People in lower income households are more likely to see this 5% benefit: 88% of those in the bottom decile, compared to 2% of the top decile.

The benefit uprating [reduces poverty by 13.5%](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=37185&region=uk&timePeriod=2023&baseline=1), including 37% of seniors. It would also [lower deep poverty by 15%](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&reform=37185&region=uk&timePeriod=2023&baseline=1), and [lower income inequality by 1-2%](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=37185&region=uk&timePeriod=2023&baseline=1), depending on the measure.

## Conclusion

As we await Hunt's final announcements, we can see that the reforms described in The Times would have a significant impact on the UK's budget and distributional outcomes, especially against a potential backdrop of no or less benefit uprating. We will continue to monitor the Autumn Statement and update our analysis as more information becomes available.
