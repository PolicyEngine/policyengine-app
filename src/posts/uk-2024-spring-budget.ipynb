    "Today, Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt announced the Government's Spring Budget 2024. This budget includes a variety of reforms, delineated by the Treasury in LINK.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, PolicyEngine will model the budgetary, societal, and distributional impacts of the budget's reforms to National Insurance, the High Income Child Benefit Charge, and the fuel duty.\n",

    "## Spring Budget 2024 reforms\n",
    "The Spring 2024 Budget includes reforms to various different segments of the tax code. Of these, PolicyEngine will be modelling the following in this article:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### National Insurance Contributions (NICs)\n",
    "* Lowering the main rate of Class 1 NICs from 10p to 8p\n",
    "* Cutting the main rate of Class 4 self-employed NICs from 8p to 6p\n",
    "\n",
    "#### High Income Child Benefit Charge\n",
    "* Increasing the income threshold for the charge from £60,000 to £80,000\n",
    "* Increasing the charge's taper range from £60,000 to £80,000\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fuel Duty\n",
    "* Extending the fuel duty's 5p rate cut for 12 months\n",
    "* Forgoing the fiscal year 2024-2025 RPI increase for the fuel duty\n",
    "\n",
    "When modelling these reforms, PolicyEngine assumes they take effect on 1 January 2024 and evaluates their impacts over calendar year 2024, differing slightly from Treasury's estimates, which are aligned with the fiscal calendar. In future development iterations, PolicyEngine hopes to be able to model the mid-year effective date of reforms like these.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other reforms\n",
    "The Chancellor's Spring Budget 2024 also codifies a number of reforms not included in the PolicyEngine model, such as a freeze on the alcohol duty, changes to the non-domiciled taxation regime, and a duty on vaping products. These reforms will not be modelled in this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reform outcomes\n",
    "Table 1 below presents PolicyEngine's estimate of each policy reform provision's key household, budgetary, and societal impact metrics. Cumulatively, the reforms are modelled to cost HM Treasury a total of £14.1 billion for calendar year 2024 and raise the net income of 78.9% of British households, particularly those with higher pre-tax income. The policies also present ambiguous impacts upon the poverty rate, while raising inequality by 0.4%."
