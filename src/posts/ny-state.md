# PolicyEngine launches in New York state

New Yorkers can now estimate their state income taxes alongside federal taxes and benefits — and change the rules, too.

New York state taxes individual income at rates ranging from 4% to 10.9%. But it also has a slew of income adjustments, supplementary rates, deductions, exemptions, and credits. Short of using tax software in April or hiring a tax accountant, how can you estimate your tax bill?

[New Yorkers can now use the free PolicyEngine app to find out.](http://policyengine.org)¹ We capture all those rules, and show your estimated state taxes (including tax credits) in the same view as your federal taxes and benefit programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

What’s more, you can customize New York’s tax policy and have PolicyEngine estimate how that new policy would affect New York² and your own household. For example, this video estimates the impact of expanding New York’s Earned Income Tax Credit.

From Governor Hochul to think tanks to families trying to better understand their own finances, we hope New Yorkers of all stripes will find valuable information in our free, open source tax model.³
