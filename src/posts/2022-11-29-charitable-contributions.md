Today is [Giving Tuesday](https://www.givingtuesday.org/), when many Americans will consider giving to charity. Filers who itemize can deduct these charitable contributions from their taxable income. For many filers, these donations will reduce tax liability, either by putting them over the itemization threshold or increasing their itemized deductions.

This video shows an example of a New York resident with $200,000 in employment income and no other itemized deductions. Without charitable contributions, PolicyEngine estimates that they would owe $64,255. If they donate $20,000, they would instead owe an estimated $58,043. That is, their taxes fall by $6,212, offsetting 31% of their donation.

Federal taxes comprise 88% of this impact.
