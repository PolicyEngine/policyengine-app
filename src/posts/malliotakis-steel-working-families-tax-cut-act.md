On Tuesday, Representatives Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY-11) and Michelle Steel (R-CA-45) introduced the [Working Families Tax Cut Act (WFTCA](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/malliotakis-steel-lead-legislation-to-provide-tax-relief-to-working-families/)) in the House, proposing a broad tax cut through increasing the federal standard deduction.

The standard deduction (which the [bill](https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:f2203ce9-a41a-3a28-8b45-509e0b364e45) renames to *“Guaranteed Deduction”*) reduces taxable income for taxpayers who choose not to itemize their deductions. The proposals would increase it by between $2,000 and $4,000 depending on filing status in 2024 and 2025.

The bill reduces this additional standard deduction by 5% of adjusted gross income exceeding:

* $200,000 for single and separate filers

* $300,000 for head of household filers

* $400,000 for married and widowed filers

## Household impacts

Consider a [single filer in New York](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&reform=14512&region=ny&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=31355) with no itemized deductions other than state income tax. The WFTCA would provide [benefits](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=14512&region=ny&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=31356) if they earn between $11,000 and $240,000, with the maximum dollar benefit of $640 at around $200,000 earnings.

The WFTCA would reduce the filer’s marginal tax rates by up to -10% in specific earnings ranges, around $15,000 and $60,000. The phase-out then raises [marginal tax rates](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&reform=14512&region=ny&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=31356) by about 1.7% when earning between $200,000 and $240,000.

The WFTCA would affect other filers differently, depending on the marital status, children, and itemized deductions like charitable contributions.

## Budgetary impact

We project that the WFTCA would cost [$50 billion in 2023](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=14512&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2). As comparison, the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimated that the bill would cost [$95 billion for 2024/25](https://twitter.com/jbuhl35/status/1666924708967727112), or an average of $47.5 billion in each year (they also provided [distributional analysis](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/working-families-tax-cut-act-june-2023/t23-0061-proposal-increase-standard-deduction)). The American Enterprise Institute, using the open-source [Tax-Calculator microsimulation model](https://taxcalc.pslmodels.org/), estimates that the bill would cost [$43 billion in 2024](https://www.aei.org/economics/flawed-approach-the-working-families-tax-cut-act-as-a-response-to-inflation/).

Both TPC and AEI use the IRS public use file (PUF) rather than the Current Population Survey March Supplement (CPS), as PolicyEngine does. They also project the microdata into future years, while we use the 2021 CPS as-is, overwriting taxes and benefits with 2023 policy rules. We will [integrate the PUF into the CPS and project it to future years](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis) in the coming months.

In New York and California, the states the authors represent, the bill would reduce tax liabilities by [$3 billion](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=14512&region=ny&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) and [$6 billion](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=14512&region=ca&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), respectively.

## Distributional impact

On average, the proposal would raise net incomes by [$382 per household](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&reform=14512&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2); this increases with income, except for the 10th decile due to the phase-out.

On a [relative basis](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&reform=14512&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), the bill would raise incomes a similar amount for deciles four through nine.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2732/0*HuuthcudLSRD2551)

We estimate that the WFTCA would benefit [75% of the population](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=14512&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), disproportionately those in deciles five through nine. As context, Representative Steel claimed in her announcement that the bill would benefit [82% of tax filers in her district](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/malliotakis-steel-lead-legislation-to-provide-tax-relief-to-working-families/).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2712/0*uK_cr-x6857z88-F)

The WFTCA would [lower poverty by 0.4%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=14512&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), disproportionately for working-age adults and [Hispanics](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.racialPovertyImpact&reform=14512&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2).

The proposal would [lower income inequality](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=14512&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) according to the three measures we estimate. It reduces the broadest measure, the Gini index, the least, and the narrowest, the share held by the top 1%, the most.

As a result of lowering marginal tax rates for low-income households, the WFTCA would [make cliffs about 1 percent less prevalent](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&reform=14512&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2).
