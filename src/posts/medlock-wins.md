The high-profile Twitter bet between [James Medlock](https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock) and [Balaji Srinivasan](http://twitter.com/balajis) has reached its conclusion, and PolicyEngine played a pivotal role in shaping the outcome. On March 16, 2023, [Medlock bet](https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1636480393007489024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) that the US would not enter hyperinflation, with [Srinivasan taking the bet](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1636797265317867520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and wagering that Bitcoin would exceed $1 million US dollars within 90 days. The bet garnered widespread attention, with Medlock pledging to donate a portion of his potential winnings to [GiveDirectly](http://givedirectly.org), a charity that provides unconditional cash transfers to extremely poor households in East Africa.

Today Medlock announced the settlement of the bet, revealing that Srinivasan had donated $500,000 to GiveDirectly and transferred an additional $500,000 to Medlock. Srinivasan also donated $500,000 in BTC to support Bitcoin Core development via Chaincode.

In [our March 23 blog post](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/medlock-donation-calculator), we presented a [mini-app](https://policyengine-james-medlock-donation-solver.streamlit.app/) built with the [policyengine-us Python package](http://github.com/policyengine/policyengine-us) to calculate how much Medlock should donate to GiveDirectly in order to fulfill his pledge of achieving a 70% effective tax rate between taxes and donations. Our calculations ranged from $333,000 to $565,000, depending on Medlock’s other income.

Our free tax calculator and custom app informed Medlock and Srinivasan’s decision on a $500,000 donation to GiveDirectly, highlighting the impact of PolicyEngine’s tools in real-life decision-making scenarios.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tax policy didn&#39;t have major implications for me here. Per calculations using PolicyEngine, getting $500k + Balaji giving $500k worked out the same for me as getting $1 mil and donating. Better for him probably, but main reason was this: <a href="https://t.co/Pj2fpczyzT">https://t.co/Pj2fpczyzT</a></p>&mdash; James Medlock (@jdcmedlock) <a href="https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1653452413809094657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

GiveDirectly, too, has confirmed and shared the outcome (note our Twitter account is [@ThePolicyEngine](http://twitter.com/thepolicyengine) rather than [@PolicyEngine](http://twitter.com/policyengine)).

We are thrilled that our `policyengine-us` Python package and Streamlit-built dashboarding app could contribute to this charitable outcome by providing Medlock with the necessary calculations to determine his donation amount. This example demonstrates the power and flexibility of our Python packages, and we look forward to continuing to build tools that can answer unique questions and support decision-making in various scenarios.
