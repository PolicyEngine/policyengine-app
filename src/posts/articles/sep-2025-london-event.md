## Event overview

PolicyEngine is hosting a special event to demonstrate our cutting-edge research, tools, and features that are transforming how policymakers and researchers analyze tax and benefit reforms. This gathering brings together professionals at the forefront of computational policy modeling and evidence-based policymaking technology.

## What to expect

### Revolutionary platform updates

Experience the unveiling of PolicyEngine v2, our next-generation policy analysis platform, with a live demonstration by our engineering team. See firsthand how our enhanced interface and capabilities make complex policy analysis more accessible and powerful than ever.

### Hyperlocal policy analysis

Discover our breakthrough capability to estimate policy impacts at the parliamentary constituency and local authority level. Our UK Country Director Nikhil Woodruff will demonstrate how our revolutionary microdata construction enables unprecedented granularity in understanding policy effects across the UK, expanding on the methodologies described in our [Enhanced CPS launch](/us/blog/enhanced-cps-launch).

### Cutting-edge research presentations

Learn about our latest research innovations, including:

- **VAT analysis with synthetic firm microdata**: Our UK Research Associate Vahid Ahmadi presents groundbreaking work on modeling VAT reforms using fully synthetic firm-level data, building on our recent [analysis of VAT threshold changes](/uk/blog/uk-vat-thresholds)
- **US policy modeling expansion**: Insights from our federal and state-level policy analysis work across the Atlantic, powered by our [Enhanced Current Population Survey](/us/blog/enhanced-cps-launch) microdata
- **AI-powered policy analysis**: How we're deploying large language models and agentic systems to transform policy research workflows, supported by our [NSF POSE grant](/us/blog/nsf-pose-phase-1-grant)

### Networking opportunities

Connect with policy researchers, government officials, think tank professionals, academic researchers, and data scientists working in public policy. The event includes dedicated networking time during registration, tea break, and an evening reception.
