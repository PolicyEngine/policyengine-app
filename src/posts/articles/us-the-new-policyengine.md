At PolicyEngine, we strive to make tax and benefit policy accessible to everyone. That’s why we’ve not only built an open source rules engine for researchers, but also a free, intuitive web app where anyone can explore policies and customizable reforms.

Today we’re launching a new version of our web app that makes public policy more transparent and interactive than ever before. Our new app makes it easier to find the specific information you’re looking for, whether that’s navigating your household through taxes and benefits under current law, understanding how a policy reform could affect you, or designing a new policy. We’ve also added new functionality to increase the customizability, analytics, and shareability.

If you’ve used the beta app, we think you’ll find the new version easier to use, and especially more delightful on mobile. We’ve also added a number of concrete new features, including:

- **Access to all household variables and policy parameters** in our model — several hundred in total — with a search box to cut down on clicks.

- **Named policies** that feed into chart titles.

- **Simplified household questionnaire** so you can estimate your taxes and benefits fast.

- **Deep linking to specific households, policies, and charts** for more reliable sharing.

- **Auto-generated code** to reproduce results with our open source Python package.

- **Cliff impact**, estimating how a reform affects the population share for whom an earnings increase would lower net income (more on that in a future post soon).
