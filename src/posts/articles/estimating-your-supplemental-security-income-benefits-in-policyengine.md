Low-income seniors and people with disabilities can claim [Supplemental Security Income](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/), a monthly cash benefit run by the [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/). Last year, [over 7 million people claimed over $50 billion in SSI benefits](https://www.ssa.gov/budget/FY22Files/2022BO.pdf).

In this post, you’ll see how to estimate your own SSI benefits based on your income using the [free PolicyEngine US web app](http://policyengine.org/us). You can also watch it in the below 90-second video.

To start, visit [\*\*policyengine.org](https://policyengine.org/)** and click **Enter PolicyEngine US\*\*.

Go to the **Your household** tab to enter your household’s info. Let’s say we’re a single parent of one disabled child with $30,000 income. Click **1** in the **Dependents** section.

Now click **Compute your net income.** SSI is in the **Benefits** section of the expandable table. This household would receive $5,934 per year (in 2022), or about $495 per month. This also assumes the household meets other requirements such as asset limits.
