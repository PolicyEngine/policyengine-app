The Autumn Budget 2024 includes substantial reforms to Capital Gains Tax (CGT), with Chancellor Rachel Reeves announcing rate increases across all tax bands. The changes raise the rates from 10% and 20% to 18% and 24%, respectively.

When accounting for behavioural responses, we project that these changes will raise £6.4 billion from 2025 to 2029\. In 2025 without behavioural responses, they will affect 1.2% of the population and reduce the Gini index of income inequality by 0.4%.

## Budgetary impacts

We project the CGT reforms will raise £6.4 billion from 2025 to 2029\.

These estimates are 29% less than HMT and 26% less than the OBR. These variations may stem from different assumptions about behavioural responses. In our model, we assume individuals will adjust their capital gains realisations with an elasticity of \-0.7 with respect to the marginal tax rate; neither HMT nor OBR specify their assumptions on this front.

Assuming [no behavioural change](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=69732&region=uk&timePeriod=2025&baseline=1), we project the change to generate £22.2 billion from 2025 to 2029\. While the OBR also provides estimates it describes as static, those account for changes in realisation behaviour, making them incomparable to our static results.

## Distributional impact

The CGT reforms affect 1.2% of the population, with impacts limited to the highest income decile. Within the top 10%, 5% see income losses above 5%, another 5% face losses under 5%, while 90% experience no change. The policy has no impact on income levels across the bottom nine deciles.

Our [distributional analysis](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=69732&region=uk&timePeriod=2025&baseline=1) shows no change in poverty measures, while the Gini index falls by 0.4%. Across most of the income distribution (the bottom 90% of households), incomes remain unchanged.
