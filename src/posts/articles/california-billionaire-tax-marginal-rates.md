On October 21, 2025, labor union SEIU United Healthcare Workers West submitted the ["2026 Billionaire Tax Act"](https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/25-0024%20%28Billionaire%20Tax%20%29.pdf) (California Initiative 25-0024) to California Attorney General Rob Bonta for title and summary preparation. The initiative would impose a one-time 5% tax on the net worth as of December 31, 2026 of California residents with wealth exceeding $1 billion.

The tax structure creates marginal tax rates on wealth between 50% and 60% during the $1.0-$1.1 billion phase-in range. This occurs because the tax applies to total wealth rather than only wealth exceeding $1 billion, causing rate increases to affect all accumulated wealth.

## The phase-in mechanism

The statutory text specifies:

> For individuals and trusts on whom tax is imposed... the tax imposed is 5 percent of the net worth of such individual or trust. In the case of an individual (other than a trust) having net worth less than $1.1 billion ($1,100,000,000), the tax imposed by this Section shall be reduced by 0.1 percentage point (but not below zero) for each $2 million ($2,000,000) by which such person's net worth falls below $1.1 billion ($1,100,000,000).

This creates a stepwise rate schedule. At exactly $1.0 billion, the tax rate is 0% and total tax is $0. At $1.1 billion, the rate reaches 5% and total tax is $55 million. Taxpayers can spread payments over five years, though the liability remains based on wealth as of December 31, 2026 regardless of subsequent wealth changes.

## Total tax liability

Multiplying wealth by the tax rate yields total tax liability. For example, at $1.1 billion, the 5% rate produces $55 million in tax ($1.1B × 5% = $55M). At $2.0 billion, the tax is $100 million ($2.0B × 5% = $100M). The chart below shows the full tax liability schedule.

## Marginal tax rates

The marginal tax rate measures how much additional tax results from a wealth increase. It equals the change in tax divided by the change in wealth.

Because the tax applies to total wealth rather than only wealth above $1 billion, each 0.1 percentage point rate increase applies to all accumulated wealth, creating marginal rates between 50% and 60% in the phase-in range.

| Initial wealth | Initial rate | Initial tax | New wealth | New rate | New tax | Change in wealth | Change in tax | Marginal rate |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| $1.000B        | 0.0%         | $0M         | $1.1B      | 5.0%     | $55.0M  | $100M            | $55.0M        | 55%           |
| $1.000B        | 0.0%         | $0M         | $1.002B    | 0.1%     | $1.0M   | $2M              | $1.0M         | 50%           |

| $1.100B        | 5.0%         | $55.0M      | $1.102B    | 5.0%     | $55.1M  | $2M              | $0.1M         | 5%            |

The marginal rate increases from 50% to 60% across the 50 discrete $2 million increments in the phase-in range, averaging 55%. Above $1.1 billion, the marginal rate drops to 5%.

The initiative requires [874,641 valid signatures](https://ballotpedia.org/California_2026_ballot_propositions) by June 25, 2026 to qualify for the November 2026 ballot.
