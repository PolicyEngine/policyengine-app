## Summary

Vice President Harris proposes expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to provide tax cuts of up to $1,500 for individuals and couples in lower-income jobs who are not raising children in their home. This analysis examines the proposal's key aspects, potential impacts, and provides economic projections from PolicyEngine’s microsimulation model.


## The proposal

In her [economic plan](https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Policy_Book_Economic-Opportunity.pdf), Harris proposes to restore the expanded Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without children to its level under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021.

This would:



* Increase the phase-in and phase-out rates from 7.65% to 15.3%
* Lower the minimum age from 25 to 19 (or 24 for students)
* Remove the maximum age, currently 65
* Raise the maximum credit from $632 to $1,774 (adjusted from $1,502 in 2021 for inflation, and continuing to rise with inflation in future years)

For a single filer, the policy phases in an increase to net income as they earn between $8,000 and $37,000.

For more examples of the policy’s household impacts, see our [2023 article](https://policyengine.org/us/research/restoring-arpa-eitc) on the ARPA EITC expansion.


## Nationwide impacts

Based on [static microsimulation modeling](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=67011&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=47732) with PolicyEngine US (version 1.103.0), we project the following economic impacts for 2025.


### Budgetary impact

We project that the EITC expansion will cost the federal government $18.9 billion in 2025. Due to state and local EITC matches, it will also cost state and local governments $2.7 billion. 


### Income distribution impacts

The average household [sees](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.relative&reform=67011&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=47732) an increase in net income of $154, between federal, state, and local EITCs, while households in the bottom two deciles gain the most on a relative basis.

16% of the population benefits, and 7% gain more than 5% of their prior income.

### Poverty and inequality impacts

We [estimate](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=67011&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=47732) that the expanded EITC would reduce the poverty rate by 1.6% (0.3 percentage points), or about 1 million people. Child poverty falls 0.1% because some children live in households with workers who file separately to them.

The Gini index of income inequality also [falls](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=67011&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=47732) by 0.3%, and the top-10 and top-1 percent shares of income fall by around 0.2%.

### Budget window impact

We estimate (in static terms) that the proposal would cost the federal government $18.9bn in 2025, with this increasing to $21.9bn in 2034. The total ten-year cost is $205.7bn.

### Labor supply responses

Incorporating elasticities of labor supply used by the Congressional Budget Office [changes](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=67060&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2) these estimates. In 2025:



* Hours worked falls by 0.09%, or 129,000 full-time equivalent jobs
* Total earnings fall by 0.05%, or $5.8bn
* The federal budgetary cost rises to $22.4bn (an 18.5% increase)

Applying this 18.5% increase to all years would raise the 10-year impact from $205.7bn to $243.8bn.


## Key findings

The PolicyEngine static microsimulation model projects the following:



1. Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to its level from 2021 would cost $206 billion over the 2025-2034 budget window, with costs rising each year.
2. The proposal disproportionately benefits lower-income households, both in terms of relative impacts on net income and population share gaining.
3. Overall poverty falls 0.3 percentage points, with the largest impact on people age 18 to 64.
4. Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, falls 0.3% .
