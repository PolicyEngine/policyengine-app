Washington state hasn’t historically had an income tax. However, in the past year, they’ve enacted a [Working Families Tax Credit](https://workingfamiliescredit.wa.gov/) (modeled after the federal Earned Income Tax Credit) and a [capital gains tax](https://dor.wa.gov/taxes-rates/other-taxes/capital-gains-tax)¹ (which is currently held up in court). With support from the [Center for Growth and Opportunity](http://thecgo.org), we’ve now modeled these policies in PolicyEngine and enabled Washington-specific impacts of federal reforms. This blog post shows a series of examples on using PolicyEngine in Washington.

You can use our [household calculator](http://policyengine.org/us/household) to estimate how much you’ll get from the Washington Working Families Tax Credit under current law.²

Using PolicyEngine’s Baseline feature, you can also compute the impact of the Working Families Tax Credit by [comparing it against a baseline where it doesn’t exist](https://policyengine.org/us/population-impact?wa_wftc_max_amount_1_rate=300&wa_wftc_max_amount_2_rate=600&wa_wftc_max_amount_3_rate=900&wa_wftc_max_amount_4_rate=1200&wa_wftc_min_amount=50&baseline_wa_wftc_max_amount_1_rate=0&baseline_wa_wftc_max_amount_2_rate=0&baseline_wa_wftc_max_amount_3_rate=0&baseline_wa_wftc_max_amount_4_rate=0&baseline_wa_wftc_min_amount=0&baseline_state_specific=WA).³

PolicyEngine lets you imagine a range of policy reforms. For example, what if the Working Families Tax Credit were $100 more generous? This video shows how to build [that policy](https://policyengine.org/us/population-impact?wa_wftc_max_amount_0_rate=400&wa_wftc_max_amount_1_rate=700&wa_wftc_max_amount_2_rate=1000&wa_wftc_max_amount_3_rate=1300&baseline_state_specific=WA) and compute its impact on Washington overall and a Washington family of four.

Finally, you can also compute the impact of federal policy reforms on Washington state; for instance, [cutting the bottom tax rate from 10% to 5%](https://policyengine.org/us/population-impact?gov_irs_income_bracket_rates_1=5&baseline_state_specific=WA).

¹ Since Washington’s capital gains tax has a $250,000 standard deduction and the Current Population Survey truncates income, PolicyEngine underestimates the revenue from the policy.

² PolicyEngine only provides estimates of taxes and benefits. Our policy parameters are based on preliminary estimates from the Washington Department of Revenue, which they may revise by September 2022. See [this discussion](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/openfisca-us/discussions/1246) for more information and consult a tax advisor.

³ PolicyEngine shows that the Working Families Tax Credit increases the share of income held by the top 10% because some high-income Current Population Survey households in Washington include tax filers that is eligible for the credit. In the future, we will avoid these small-N sources of volatility by using the full CPS for each state, reweighted to resemble a state according to various aggregate statistics.
