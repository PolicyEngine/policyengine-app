PolicyEngine has been awarded a $300,000 Phase I grant from the National Science Foundation's [Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems-pose). This grant will support our work to strengthen and expand the open-source ecosystem around economic policy analysis tools.

## About the POSE Program

The NSF POSE program helps open-source projects develop robust ecosystems with strong governance, community engagement, and technical infrastructure. Phase I focuses on ecosystem discovery and planning, while Phase II provides implementation funding for projects ready to scale their impact.

## Project Activities

Through this grant, PolicyEngine will:

### Ecosystem Discovery and Research

- Conduct 100+ stakeholder interviews to understand the needs of policy researchers, government agencies, nonprofits, and academic institutions
- Map the landscape of policy analysis tools and identify gaps in current capabilities
- Study successful open-source economic modeling projects to learn best practices

### Community Building and Engagement

- Attend and present at key conferences to engage with the policy analysis community
- Develop partnerships with organizations that can contribute to and benefit from our tools
- Create documentation and resources to lower barriers for new contributors
- Establish mentorship programs to support diverse contributors

### Governance Development

- Design governance structures that support transparent decision-making and community involvement
- Develop sustainable funding models that align with our open-source mission
- Create processes for managing contributions and maintaining code quality

## Learning from TAXSIM's Success

Dr. Dan Feenberg, creator of TAXSIM (cited in over 1,100 academic publications), will serve as our external mentor through the I-Corps for POSE training. TAXSIM has successfully built a large user community at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and we'll learn from their decades of experience creating an ecosystem around tax microsimulation tools. Many current TAXSIM users are potential PolicyEngine users, and Dr. Feenberg is helping us understand how to best serve this community's needs.

## Conference Participation

As part of our ecosystem discovery efforts, we'll be attending and presenting at major conferences in economics, public policy, and open-source software development. These events will help us engage with potential users and contributors, learn from other projects, and share our work with the broader community.

## Get Involved

We invite researchers, developers, and policy analysts to join our open-source community. Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PolicyEngine) to contribute, or explore our platform at [policyengine.org](https://policyengine.org) to see how we're democratizing policy analysis.

The NSF POSE Phase I grant will help PolicyEngine strengthen its open-source ecosystem and expand access to sophisticated policy analysis tools for researchers, policymakers, and citizens alike.
