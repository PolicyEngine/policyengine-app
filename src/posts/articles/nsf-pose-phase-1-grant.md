PolicyEngine has been awarded a $295,900 Phase I grant from the National Science Foundation's Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program. This grant will support our transformation from an open-source project into a sustainable open-source ecosystem that democratizes access to sophisticated economic policy analysis tools.

## About the POSE Program

The NSF POSE program helps open-source projects develop into robust ecosystems with sustainable governance, community engagement, and technical infrastructure. Phase I focuses on ecosystem discovery and planning, while Phase II provides implementation funding for established projects ready to scale their impact.

## Project Overview

Our POSE Phase I project develops a comprehensive plan for establishing PolicyEngine as a robust open-source ecosystem through three key objectives:

### Ecosystem Discovery

We will identify gaps in policy analysis capabilities and strengthen our sustainable revenue model that combines:

- Philanthropic support for our public good mission
- Research contracts to enhance our analytical tools
- Development funding from API users expanding our model's capabilities
- Cost-based API hosting fees for organizations using our infrastructure

### Governance Evolution

We will evolve from a project of the Policy Simulation Library Foundation into an independent 501(c)(3) organization with a governance structure that balances open-source values with sustainable growth.

### Community Engagement

Community engagement professionals will nurture our diverse community of policy researchers, benefit access practitioners, and contributors while expanding partnerships that enhance our model's capabilities.

## Technical Innovation

PolicyEngine advances economic policy analysis by combining precision rule-based software with advanced microsimulation strategies. Our platform features:

- **Comprehensive tax-benefit rules engine**: Precisely models intricate policy rules across federal, state, and local levels
- **Advanced microsimulation methods**: Uses quantile regression forests and gradient descent to reduce deviations from administrative statistics by over 90%
- **Accessible interfaces**: Web application, API, and Python package with AI-powered explanations

## Community Impact

Our open-source community includes 50 current developers and over 100 total contributors who enhance our codebase through GitHub. Contributors make substantial technical additions:

- Economists parameterize new tax policies
- Software developers improve our web interface and API functionality
- Data scientists enhance our microsimulation methods

## Broader Impacts

PolicyEngine transforms public engagement with economic policy by democratizing access to sophisticated analysis tools. Our hosted API services power benefit screening tools used by Gates Foundation-supported nonprofits and venture-backed startups, helping address the $70 billion gap between benefit eligibility and enrollment.

## Project Team

The project will be led by:

- **Max Ghenis** (PI/CEO): Overseeing the scoping project and strategic planning
- **Nikhil Woodruff** (CTO): Assessing technical requirements for scaling the open-source ecosystem
- **Leigh Gibson** (COO): Supporting governance development and ecosystem discovery
- **Community Engagement Manager**: Leading ecosystem discovery and stakeholder engagement

## Expert Mentorship

Dr. Dan Feenberg, creator of TAXSIM (cited in over 1,100 academic publications), will serve as our external mentor through the I-Corps for POSE training. Dr. Feenberg is collaborating with PolicyEngine to build an open-source emulator that replicates TAXSIM's interface, enabling the National Bureau of Economic Research to migrate TAXSIM's backend to an open-source environment.

## Looking Ahead

This Phase I grant enables PolicyEngine to develop a comprehensive plan for sustainable growth while maintaining our commitment to open-source principles. Through ecosystem discovery, governance evolution, and community engagement, we will establish the foundation for long-term sustainability and impact.

The grant will fund critical activities including:

- 100+ stakeholder interviews to validate our distributed development model
- Development of governance structures for our transition to an independent 501(c)(3)
- Community building strategies to expand our contributor base
- Technical infrastructure planning for sustainable growth

## Recognition

PolicyEngine has been recognized by the UN-endorsed Digital Public Goods Alliance and powers analysis at major institutions including the Niskanen Center. Recent support from NEO Philanthropy and the Nuffield Foundation complements this NSF grant in supporting our transition to a sustainable organization.

## Get Involved

As we embark on this exciting phase of growth, we invite researchers, developers, and policy analysts to join our open-source community. Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PolicyEngine) to contribute, or explore our platform at [policyengine.org](https://policyengine.org) to see how we're democratizing policy analysis.

The NSF POSE Phase I grant marks a significant milestone in PolicyEngine's journey toward becoming a sustainable open-source ecosystem that advances evidence-based policymaking for the benefit of all.
