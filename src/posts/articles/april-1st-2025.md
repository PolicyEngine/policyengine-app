At PolicyEngine, our mission of democratizing policy analysis and modeling state tax policies relies significantly on charitable donations. Many states offer unique tax credits designed to encourage charitable contributions that support community needs. PolicyEngine is excited to begin accepting donations in more accessible ways than traditional cash donations.

Below, we highlight several state tax credits that donors can utilize to enhance their contributions:

## Maryland Venison Donation Credit

Maryland provides a [non-refundable tax credit](https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2024RS/fnotes/bil_0000/sb0440.pdf) to encourage hunters to donate processed venison to charitable organizations addressing hunger. The tax credit of $75 per deer, up to $300 annually. It covers the cost of processing deer meat donated to qualified 501(c)(3) organizations.

## South Carolina Deer Processing Donation Credit
