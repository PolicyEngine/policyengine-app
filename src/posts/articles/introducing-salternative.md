Today we’re excited to launch **SALTernative**, a free web app that lets anyone — from researchers and journalists to households and Hill staff — simulate reforms to the state‑and‑local‑tax (SALT) deduction and the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) and see their effects on:

- **The federal budget** (2026–35)

- **Average household incomes** across the distribution

- **Individual households’ net income**, effective SALT caps, and property‑tax subsidy rates

You can start exploring right now at [**policyengine.org/us/salternative**](https://policyengine.org/us/salternative).

## Why a SALT + AMT model, and why now?

- **Major policy change may be imminent.** When individual provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expire after 2025, the explicit $10,000 SALT cap vanishes and AMT parameters revert, reshaping incentives for millions of taxpayers.

- **The interaction matters.** The AMT disallows the SALT deduction, creating an _effective_ SALT cap that can remain even without a statutory cap.

- **Transparent evidence is scarce.** While existing estimates are static tables for individual reforms, SALTernative is flexible, open‑source, and free.

## What you can do with SALTernative

| Question                                                                                                | How the tool helps                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _“What if we doubled the SALT cap for married couples but kept the AMT?”_                               | Toggle a checkbox and compare distributional and budget impacts side‑by‑side.                                                   |
| _“If TCJA expires, how large is the effective SALT cap for a $250,000‑income household in New Jersey?”_ | Enter the household in the **Personalized Calculator** and view the value (it depends on other factors like mortgage interest). |
| _“How much revenue would repealing both SALT and the AMT raise or lose over 2026‑35?”_                  | Run the scenario and read the ten‑year budget window total.                                                                     |

Key features at launch include:

- **Current‑law vs. current‑policy baselines.** Simulate against either an automatic TCJA sunset or a full extension.

- **Behavioral responses.** Optionally incorporate CBO elasticities so earnings adjust when marginal tax rates change.

- **Transparent methodology.** We’ve developed the tool [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/salt-amt-calculator/), using the open-source PolicyEngine US microsimulation model — including a full set of state income tax rules, critical for SALT and AMT calculations.

## Join us to learn more — April 24 webinar

We’re hosting a **joint webinar with [Arnold Ventures](http://arnoldventures.org)** (whose generous support made SALTernative possible) on **Thursday, April 24, at 10 AM ET**.

We’ll walk through live demos, answer technical questions, and discuss how analysts are already using the model.

👉 [**Register here**](https://arnoldventures.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_qvtqn6DbRZeRzMaIWDwUDg#/registration)

## Get started

1. Head to [**policyengine.org/us/salternative**](https://policyengine.org/us/salternative).

1. Choose a baseline, adjust SALT and AMT settings, and watch the charts update.

1. Share your findings, cite the model, and help create **a world guided by transparent, verifiable evidence.**

_Thank you to Arnold Ventures for supporting this work, and to our open‑source contributors who reviewed code, built datasets, and stress‑tested the interface._

See you at the webinar!
