Most of our users interact with PolicyEngine via our [UK](http://policyengine.org/uk) and [US](http://policyengine.org/us) web apps, where they enter household information and policy reforms to compute the impact of customisable tax and benefit policy. We’ve also made this information available to developers through our [Python](http://openfisca.us) [packages](http://openfisca.uk) and [web API](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1y-kRDOssYyRwEVTsntqGxoBtvFS4HKMQD-U0Ga9YzJE/preview). Today, we’re launching companion tools in the [UK](http://policyengine.org/uk/api-explorer) and [US](http://policyengine.org/us/api-explorer) to explore core components of our API: variables and policy parameters.

## What the PolicyEngine API does

Anything you can do with the PolicyEngine app, you can do with our API. Here are some examples:

1. Get parameters in our tax-benefit model, along with details about their current value, their data type and their descriptions ([policyengine.org/uk/parameters](https://policyengine.org/uk/parameters))

1. Get variables in our tax-benefit model, along with details about their current value, their data type and their descriptions ([policyengine.org/uk/parameters](https://policyengine.org/uk/parameters))

1. Calculate tax-benefit variables for a given household ([policyengine.org/us/calculate](https://policyengine.org/uk/calculate))

Using this requires knowing the variables and parameters available, and what they represent. Until now, API users had to extract all of them, or consult our [openfisca-us](http://github.com/policyengine/openfisca-us) or [openfisca-uk](http://github.com/policyengine/openfisca-uk) repos. Now, it’s as simple as searching in [policyengine.org/uk/api-explorer](https://policyengine.org/uk/api-explorer) or [policyengine.org/us/api-explorer](https://policyengine.org/us/api-explorer).

## The API explorer

Inspired by other OpenFisca country models (for example, [OpenFisca-France’s legislation explorer](https://legislation.fr.openfisca.org/)), [policyengine.org/uk/api-explorer](https://policyengine.org/uk/api-explorer) and [policyengine.org/us/api-explorer](https://policyengine.org/us/api-explorer) display metadata for any variable or policy parameter.

The API explorer includes a search interface, which lists variables and parameters with similar names. Selecting one provides detail about it on the right, such as the entity, period, and default value for variables.

For parameters, the API explorer shows the description, the location in the Python package’s parameter tree, and the current value.
