We are excited to announce the addition of the Kansas income tax code to [PolicyEngine US](http://policyengine.org/us)! This update allows users to analyze and understand the tax policies in Kansas, including tax rates, deductions, exemptions, and credits available to Kansas residents.

## How Kansas income taxes work

Kansas levies income taxes at different rates for joint and non-joint filers. The tax brackets and rates are as follows:

For joint filers:

- 3.1% on income up to $30,000

- 5.25% on income between $30,000 and $60,000

- 5.7% on income over $60,000

For non-joint filers:

- 3.1% on income up to $15,000

- 5.25% on income between $15,000 and $30,000

- 5.7% on income over $30,000

Kansas offers a personal exemption of $2,250 per person. It allows either itemized deductions or a standard deduction ranging from $3,500 to $8,000, depending on filing status, with a bonus for elderly and blind filers. The state also limits its taxable Social Security subtraction to filers with an adjusted gross income (AGI) at or below $75,000.

In addition to the tax rates and exemptions, Kansas also matches 25% of the federal Child and Dependent Care Credit (CDCC) and 17% of the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).

The addition of the Kansas income tax code to PolicyEngine will enable users to better understand the impact of tax policies on Kansas residents. Users can now model different policy scenarios, analyze the effects of proposed tax reforms, and explore the intricacies of Kansas state income tax.
