[On February 6](https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-tax-cut), Governor Andy Beshear signed [House Bill 1](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/25rs/hb1.html), which reduces Kentucky's flat income tax from a rate of 4% to 3.5% starting in 2026. The bill previously passed the Kentucky House of Representatives with a [vote of 90–7](https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-legislature-tax) and the Senate with a [34–3 vote](https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-income-tax).

We at PolicyEngine have updated our model to reflect these changes and analyzed their effects on the state of Kentucky and its residents.

Key results for 2026:

- Reduces state revenues by $684 million

- Benefits 73% of Kentucky residents

- Lowers the state's Supplemental Poverty Measure by 1.0%

- Increases the Gini index of income inequality by 0.14%

## Household Impacts

To understand the extent of this reform, it is important to note that higher-income households receive larger tax savings because they have more taxable income and therefore higher initial tax liability. For example, a childless adult earning $20,000 in Kentucky gains $58 from the 0.5pp rate reduction, while they would gain $483 if they earned $100,000, or $1,664 if they earned $500,000.

Below, Figure 1 displays the reduction in Kentucky income tax for a childless adult between $0 and $500,000 of household earnings. Since Kentucky's Family Size Credit fully offsets state tax liability for those below the federal poverty line, childless adults with income below $16,040 in 2026 will not benefit from the tax cut.[^1]

## Statewide Impacts

Using PolicyEngine static modeling, the individual income tax rate reduction enacted in Kentucky will [cost the state $684 million](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143) for tax year 2026. The measure would also increase federal revenues by $48 million, as residents would have less state income tax to take as an itemized deduction. On net, the tax cut would increase residents' net income by $636 million, without considering behavioral responses.

73% of Kentuckians will see an [increase in their net income](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143), including 99% of those in the top income decile and 6% of those in the bottom decile.

The tax cut will provide an [average benefit of $335](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143) per household, ranging from $5 in the bottom income decile to $1,470 in the top decile.

The tax changes are projected to [reduce Kentucky's poverty rate by 1.3%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143), applying the Supplemental Poverty Measure, while leaving deep poverty unchanged. The income tax reduction will also increase the state's Gini index of income inequality [by 0.14%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143).

## Conclusion

The 0.5pp rate reduction of Kentucky's income tax will lower state revenues by $684 million in 2026, while reducing poverty by 1.3% and increasing income inequality by 0.14%. The reform reduces tax liability for households across all income deciles, with higher-income households receiving larger benefits on both an [absolute](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143) and [relative](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.relative&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143) basis.
