With the enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025, we're launching [**ACA-Calc**](https://policyengine.org/us/aca-calc) ‚Äî an interactive calculator that shows how ACA subsidies affect individual households under both current and proposed policies.

[**_Calculate your household's premium tax credits here._**](https://policyengine.org/us/aca-calc)

## What the tool does

ACA-Calc allows users to estimate Affordable Care Act premium tax credits for any household configuration. The tool calculates subsidies under:

- **Current enhanced schedule**: The improved subsidies enacted through the American Rescue Plan Act and extended through 2025

- **Original schedule**: The pre-2021 subsidy levels that would return if enhancements expire

- **Custom policies**: User-defined premium cap schedules

By showing side-by-side comparisons, the tool reveals how different policy choices affect household premiums and subsidy eligibility.

## Examples

To illustrate the tool's capabilities, let's explore two household scenarios.

### Single adult household in Texas

Consider a 35-year-old single adult living in Dallas, Texas, earning $45,000 annually.

Under the enhanced schedule, this household would receive $3,024 in annual premium tax credits, capping their premium contribution at 4.5% of income. If the enhancements expire and the original schedule returns, their credit would drop to $1,848, increasing their premium cap to 6.52% of income ‚Äî a difference of $1,176 per year.

### Family of four in New York

Now consider a married couple with two children in Syracuse, New York. The household head is 40 years old, and they earn $85,000 annually.

This family would receive $8,640 in annual credits under the enhanced schedule (capping premiums at 6.5% of income). Under the original schedule, they would receive only $3,456 (with an 8.33% premium cap) ‚Äî a difference of $5,184 per year.

These examples demonstrate how the enhanced subsidies particularly benefit middle-income households that would face higher premium burdens under the original formula.

## Key features

### üìä Comprehensive household inputs

The calculator accepts detailed household information:

- **Location**: State and county (for accurate benchmark premium data)

- **Income**: Household Modified Adjusted Gross Income

- **Family composition**: Number and ages of household members

- **Filing status**: Single, married filing jointly, or head of household

### üí∞ Multiple policy comparisons

Users can compare outcomes across three scenarios:

- **Enhanced schedule**: Current law through 2025, with expanded subsidies for lower premiums

- **Original schedule**: Pre-2021 baseline if enhancements expire

- **Custom schedule**: Define your own premium cap thresholds

### üìà Detailed results

For each scenario, the tool displays:

- **Annual premium tax credit**: Total subsidy amount

- **Monthly premium tax credit**: Subsidy divided across 12 months

- **Premium percentage cap**: Maximum premium as percentage of income

- **Benchmark premium**: Second-lowest-cost Silver plan in your area

- **Required contribution**: Amount you would pay toward premiums

### üîç Interactive analysis

The tool provides instant recalculation as you adjust:

- Household income levels

- Number of household members

- Ages of family members

- Geographic location

This enables rapid exploration of how different circumstances affect subsidy eligibility and amounts.

### üåç Nationwide coverage

ACA-Calc includes benchmark premium data for all counties across the United States, ensuring accurate subsidy calculations regardless of location.

## How it works

The calculator implements the ACA premium tax credit formula using PolicyEngine's validated rules engine:

1. **Determines household size and income** relative to the Federal Poverty Line

2. **Looks up the benchmark premium** (second-lowest-cost Silver plan) for your county

3. **Calculates the applicable percentage** from the premium cap schedule

4. **Computes your required contribution** as that percentage of income

5. **Subtracts your contribution from the benchmark premium** to determine the credit amount

The tool applies the same calculation methods used in PolicyEngine's full microsimulation model, which has been validated against official sources including Internal Revenue Service data.

## Why it matters

With Congress debating whether to extend the enhanced premium tax credits, ACA-Calc helps households understand what's at stake. For millions of Americans purchasing coverage through ACA marketplaces, the difference between the enhanced and original subsidy schedules can mean:

- Hundreds or thousands of dollars in annual savings

- The difference between affordable and unaffordable coverage

- Access to lower-deductible, more comprehensive health plans

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that allowing the enhancements to expire would reduce marketplace enrollment by approximately 3.4 million people.

## Get started

ACA-Calc is available now at [**policyengine.org/us/aca-calc**](https://policyengine.org/us/aca-calc).
