## A young family in Minnesota

Consider a married couple, both 35, with two young children ages 4 and 7. Here are their details:

Based on [U.S. Census Bureau trade statistics](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html), the average American consumed $1,275 in Chinese imports and $8,025 in other foreign goods in 2023. We’ve given this household half this nationwide average (which may fall in response to tariffs), or twice the per-capita values for a four-person household.

Under Vice President Harris’s proposed policies, this family would see their net income increase by $2,600 to $57,777, driven by the expanded Child Tax Credit. Their federal refundable credits would increase from $5,039 to $9,639, as you can view in detail in the _Federal Credits_ tab of the right hand table.

Under President Trump’s proposed policies, their net income would decrease by $3,160 to $52,017, due to the impact of new tariffs on imported goods. While the plan includes provisions like making overtime and tip income tax-exempt, this family doesn’t have income in those categories to offset the tariff costs.

## A semi-retired couple in Florida

Our second example is a semi-retired couple, both 68, living in Florida. They receive $45,000 in Social Security benefits and earn additional income through part-time work ($20,000 in regular wages, $8,000 in tips, and $4,000 in overtime). They spend $1,000 annually on Chinese goods and $5,000 on other foreign products.

Under Trump’s proposed policies, this couple would see their net income increase by $578 to $74,370. The tax exemptions on their tip and overtime income, along with changes to Social Security taxation, outweigh the impact of new tariffs. Their income tax before credits would decrease from $3,208 to $1,530.

Under Harris’s policies, their net income would remain unchanged at $73,792, as her reforms target different demographic groups and income levels.

## A professional family in New York City

Our third example examines a married couple, both 45, with one child age 12, living in New York City. Their financial profile:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*Qzx5nqo0BcLOKrWH)

Harris’s policies would increase their net income by $1,000 to $116,790, through expanded child tax benefits. Trump’s policies would decrease their net income by $1,132 to $114,658, with tariff costs outweighing the benefits from the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap removal.

## A high-net-worth individual in California

Our final example is a single 55-year-old living in California with investment income. Their income includes:

- Wages: $100,000

- Capital gains: $800,000

- Qualified dividends: $20,000

- Non-qualified dividends: $5,000

- Rental income: $24,000

- Import spending: $2,000 Chinese goods, $10,000 other foreign goods

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*zl0R7x035uQi75HN)

Under Trump’s policies, their net income would increase by $28,114 to $571,473. This change comes from the removal of the SALT deduction cap, which reduces tax liability in high-tax states like California.

Under Harris’s policies, their net income would decrease by $7,479 to $571,473, due to changes to capital gains taxation for high-income households.

## Key takeaways

These examples show how each candidate’s proposals affect households differently based on:

- Family composition and age

- Sources and levels of income (wages, investments, tips, overtime, Social Security)

- State of residence and local tax burden

- Spending patterns on imported goods (the U.S. imported [$427 billion in goods from China](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html) and [$3.1 trillion in total goods](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/AnnualPressHighlights.pdf) in 2023)

- Eligibility for tax credits

The examples demonstrate impacts ranging from changes of a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars.
