PolicyEngine is pleased to announce that we have received an 18-month, $200,000 general operating support grant from [NEO Philanthropy](https://neophilanthropy.org/)'s Economic Mobility & Opportunity Fund. This funding will help advance our mission of democratizing policy analysis through our free, open-source microsimulation tools.

Through this support, PolicyEngine will continue expanding our technological capabilities and enhancing our platform that enables policymakers, researchers, journalists, and citizens to analyze how public policies affect individuals and communities. Our tools provide interactive visualizations of policy impacts across demographics, helping inform evidence-based policy discussions at federal and state levels.

"We're grateful for NEO Philanthropy's support in helping us expand access to sophisticated policy analysis tools," said Max Ghenis, co-founder and CEO of PolicyEngine. "This funding will strengthen our ability to serve diverse stakeholders who are working to understand and shape effective public policy."
