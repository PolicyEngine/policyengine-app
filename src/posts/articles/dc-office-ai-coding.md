When we needed a new DC office, we started like most organizations do: a Google Doc listing pros and cons of different coworking spaces. Then we realized we could make a better decision by turning it into a software project.

## From spreadsheet to interactive comparison

Using Claude Code, we built a [complete microsite](https://policyengine.github.io/dc-office-comparison/) to compare eight DC coworking spaces. The site includes interactive maps, detailed comparison tables, and transit analysis for our team members' commute patterns.

The most interesting feature: we used the Google Maps API to calculate actual travel times from our core DC team members' locations. This transformed subjective "centrally located" claims into objective data we could compare across options.

## What AI coding agents unlocked

This continues a pattern we've observed: when you frame any problem as a software project, AI coding agents can unleash their full creative potential. Instead of static notes, we got:

- Interactive Leaflet.js maps showing each space's location
- Structured comparison data across price, amenities, and accessibility
- Real commute time calculations for our team
- A reusable tool for future office decisions

One unexpected challenge: Claude Code (using Opus 4.1 at the time) developed a strong preference for Open Gov Hub. We had to explicitly request more objective analysis to get balanced comparisons. The newer Sonnet 4.5 model we now use shows less of this behavior.

## The result

We moved into the [Open Gov Hub](https://www.opengovhub.org/). The [microsite](https://policyengine.github.io/dc-office-comparison/) helped us make the decision systematically. Open Gov Hub stood out for its mission alignment—housing 40+ civic tech and policy organizations—combined with practical advantages: central location with 23-minute metro access from our Arlington team members, 10-minute bike ride from our DC-based staff, competitive pricing for dedicated desks, and membership in a global coworking network. The space includes a balcony and conference rooms, and we're already planning policy-focused events with the other organizations in the building.
