    "Today, Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt announced the Government's Spring Budget 2024. This budget includes a variety of reforms, delineated by the Treasury [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spring-budget-2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, PolicyEngine will model the budgetary, societal, and distributional impacts of the budget's reforms to National Insurance, the High Income Child Benefit Charge, and the fuel duty. *To view the impacts of these reforms upon society in PolicyEngine's interactive reform modeling tool, visit [this link](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?reform=49773&baseline=1&time_period=2024&region=uk&focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&timePeriod=2024).*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spring Budget 2024 reforms\n",
    "The Spring 2024 Budget includes reforms to various different segments of the tax code. Of these, PolicyEngine will be modelling the following in this article:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### National Insurance Contributions (NICs)\n",
    "* Lowering the main rate of Class 1 NICs from 10p to 8p\n",
    "* Cutting the main rate of Class 4 self-employed NICs from 8p to 6p\n",
    "\n",
    "#### High Income Child Benefit Charge\n",
    "* Increasing the income threshold for the charge from £60,000 to £80,000\n",
    "* Increasing the charge's taper range from £60,000 to £80,000\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fuel Duty\n",
    "* Extending the fuel duty's 5p rate cut for 12 months\n",
    "* Forgoing the fiscal year 2024-2025 RPI increase for the fuel duty\n",
    "\n",
    "When modelling these reforms, PolicyEngine assumes they take effect on 1 January 2024 and evaluates their impacts over calendar year 2024, differing slightly from Treasury's estimates, which are aligned with the fiscal calendar.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other reforms\n",
    "The Chancellor's Spring Budget 2024 also codifies a number of reforms not included in the PolicyEngine model, such as a freeze on the alcohol duty, changes to the non-domiciled taxation regime, and a duty on vaping products. These reforms will not be modelled in this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reform outcomes\n",
    "Table 1 below presents PolicyEngine's estimate of each policy reform provision's key household, budgetary, and societal impact metrics. Cumulatively, the reforms are modelled to cost HM Treasury a total of £14.1 billion for calendar year 2024 and raise the net income of 77.4% of British households, particularly those with higher pre-tax income. The policies also present ambiguous impacts upon the poverty rate, while raising inequality by 0.4%."

    "The six modeled reforms of the Spring Budget 2023 would increase the net income of households by 1.2% on average. Under this reform, top-earning deciles would disproportionately benefit. Decile 9, the biggest beneficiary in relative terms, would experience a 1.9% gain in disposable income, while deciles 1 through 3 receive between 0.3% and 0.4%. In absolute terms, this equates to a £46 increase in post-tax income for earners in the lowest decile and a £1,402 increase for those in the top decile (£1,386 for those in decile 9). Similarly, 99.6% of earners in decile 9 and 77.4% of earners in decile 10 experience an increase in net income under these reforms, while 36.2% of earners in the lowest decile gain."

    "For a single person with only employment income, the six reforms evaluated in this article produce a benefit if they earn at least £12,750, producing a maximum benefit of £754 if the individual earns £50,270 per year. This assumes the individual consumes no fuel impacted by the fuel duty freeze; if the same person were to spend the UK average of [£1,176](https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/cheap-car-insurance/average-cost-petrol-car) in 2024 on petrol, they would save a further £96, no matter what their pre-tax income.\n"

Again, these reforms would produce no increase to post-tax income until the head of household earns £12,750 per year, after which the families net income will rise, until reaching a peak of £2,874 when the head makes £60,000. After this point, the post-tax benefit drops as the High Income Child Benefit Charge phases in, until the end of its taper at £80,000, at which all households see a net income increase of £754.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "PolicyEngine estimates the cost of the Spring Budget 2023's reforms to National Insurance, the High Income Child Benefit Charge, and the fuel duty at £14.1 billion in 2024. Cumulatively, these reforms will raise the net income of 77.4% of British households, with a disproportionately positive impact upon higher-income households. We also find a small effect on poverty reduction, as well as a 0.5% increase in inequality. For readers interested in generating their own society-wide tax reform simulations or better understanding how these reforms will impact their household in the coming fiscal year, we invite you to use our personalised [PolicyEngine calculator](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?reform=49773&baseline=1&time_period=2024&region=uk&focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&timePeriod=2024), available on desktop and mobile devices."
