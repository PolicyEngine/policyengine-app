The earned income tax credit (EITC) is a federal tax credit for low-income filers with earned income. The credit is refundable, meaning that the taxpayer can receive money back in the form of a refund if their tax liability is reduced below zero. [Oregon is one of 29 states](https://www.taxcreditsforworkersandfamilies.org/state-tax-credits/) or similar program to the federal EITC.

## Introduction to the Oregon EITC

The Oregon EITC has two elements. For filers with children under three years old, the state provides 12% of the federal EITC. For filers without young children, Oregon matches 9% of the federal EITC. PolicyEngine has now modeled the Oregon EITC match, along with other credits and subtractions. In this blog post, we’ll walk you through the process of estimating your EITC match in Oregon using PolicyEngine.
