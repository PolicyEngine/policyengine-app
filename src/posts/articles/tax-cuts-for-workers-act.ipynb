    "## How the EITC and TCWA work\n",
    "\n",
    "While the US provides the EITC to filers with and without qualifying children, it limits eligibility and reduces the amount for those without children. Such filers must be between ages 25 and 65, and the credit phases in at 7.65% of earnings until earnings reach $4,220 (in 2026). At $10,840 of adjusted gross income ($18,100 for joint filers), the credit is reduced with 7.65% of AGI.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2021, the US passed the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), which included an expansion to the EITC for filers without qualifying children. ARPA lowered the minimum age to 19 (24 for eligible students) and removed the maximum age. It also doubled the phase-in and phase-out rates to 15.3%, while increasing the earnings and AGI levels that governed the credit, thereby increasing the maximum credit value. It did not adjust the “married filing joint bonus”, an additional AGI level for joint filers before the credit starts phasing out. Read our report on the ARPA EITC [here](https://policyengine.org/us/research/restoring-arpa-eitc).\n",
    "\n",
    "The TCWA restores ARPA’s EITC changes, while setting the dollar figures to their 2021 values starting in 2026 (rather than the values they would have been if ARPA were made permanent, due to inflation adjustments). Table 1 displays these parameter values under current law and TCWA as of 2026.\n"

The maximum net income increase occurs between earnings of $10,000 and $19,000 with a spike at $18,000, due to the higher phase-out start."

Applying labor supply elasticities from the Congressional Budget Office, the federal cost rises 168.8% to $175.8 billion over the budget window. For example, applying CBO elasticities in 2026, we project that the reform [reduces earning](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=81478&focus=policyOutput.laborSupplyImpact.earnings.overall.relative&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps), which in turn reduces tax revenues and increases outlays for programs like SNAP.\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tax Cuts for Workers Act would cost the federal government $65.4 billion over the 2026-35 budget window, assuming no behavioral responses. Accounting for state and local tax impacts, which add 21% to the aggregate impact beyond the federal taxes, it increases net income for 10% of the population, with an average household increase of $59 ($590 per affected household). Households in the first and second income deciles would see the largest benefits ($95 and $91 respectively). The TCWA is projected to reduce poverty by 0.3% and the Gini index of income inequality by 0.05%. While it reduces marginal tax rates for the lowest earners, substitution effects from the higher marginal tax rates in the phase-out range combine with income effects to reduce labor supply and increase costs when applying CBO’s labor supply elasticities.\n",
