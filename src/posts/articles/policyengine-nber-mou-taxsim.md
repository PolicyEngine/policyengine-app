We're excited to announce that PolicyEngine has partnered with the [National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)](https://nber.org) to ensure researchers worldwide continue to have access to critical tax microsimulation tools. Through our [memorandum of understanding](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V5TJk7C01CLYP_FXUZTmHEdLk-WCV4WN/view?usp=sharing), we're building an open-source emulator of [TAXSIM](https://taxsim.nber.org), NBER's tax calculator that has powered academic research and government policy analysis for nearly five decades.

## Why TAXSIM matters

Since the 1970s, TAXSIM has set the gold standard for tax microsimulation. Daniel Feenberg, NBER's IT Director, created and maintains this tool that enables groundbreaking research on everything from tax reform impacts to income inequality. Researchers have cited [Feenberg and Coutts (1993)](https://taxsim.nber.org/feenberg-coutts.pdf) in over 900 academic publications according to Google Scholar. Government agencies including the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on Taxation, and state revenue departments rely on TAXSIM for policy analysis.

TAXSIM calculates federal and state tax liabilities for households across different years and policy scenarios, helping researchers understand exactly how tax changes affect real families. This consistency and reliability make it a cornerstone of evidence-based policymaking.

## Our collaboration with NBER

We're working directly with Daniel Feenberg and James Poterba, President and CEO of NBER, to build the next generation of tax microsimulation tools. This isn't our first collaboration with Dr. Feenberg — he serves as an external mentor through our [NSF POSE Phase I grant](https://policyengine.org/us/research/nsf-pose-phase-1-grant), helping us build a robust open-source ecosystem for policy analysis.

Our partnership ensures that:
- Researchers maintain uninterrupted access to tax microsimulation capabilities
- The tool evolves with modern features while preserving backward compatibility
- The codebase becomes open-source, enabling community contributions and transparency

## What we're building

We're developing the TAXSIM emulator as a fully open-source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-taxsim). Our approach combines the best of both worlds:

**Preserving what works:** The emulator will maintain complete compatibility with existing TAXSIM functionality. Researchers can continue using their existing workflows and analyses without any disruption.

**Adding modern capabilities:** We're enhancing the tool with features researchers have long requested:
- Open-source transparency for full auditability
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Integration with PolicyEngine's broader microsimulation infrastructure
- A new dashboard for comparing results across thousands of tax scenarios

Both organizations rigorously validate the emulator to ensure it matches TAXSIM's outputs exactly. Dr. Feenberg provides technical guidance throughout the development process, ensuring we capture every detail that makes TAXSIM so valuable to the research community.

## The path forward

Our organizations designed a smooth transition plan. Initially, taxsim.nber.org will host the integrated tool, with TAXSIM continuing its current operations through at least the 2024 tax year. We'll ensure researchers experience no disruption in their work.

We plan to launch the enhanced capabilities later this year, including our new comparison dashboard that will provide unprecedented insights into tax policy impacts across different household types and income levels.

## What this means for the research community

This partnership goes beyond maintaining existing tools — we're expanding access to rigorous policy analysis. Making tax microsimulation open-source and adding modern features allows us to:
- Enable more researchers to contribute to and validate the codebase
- Help new researchers learn and use these tools more easily
- Ensure these capabilities remain available for decades to come
- Create opportunities for innovation in tax policy analysis

We're honored to work with NBER to carry forward Dr. Feenberg's decades of work on TAXSIM. Together, we're ensuring that the next generation of researchers and policymakers have even better tools to understand how tax policies affect families across the income spectrum.
