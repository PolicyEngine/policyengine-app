We are excited to announce that the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) has added PolicyEngine to their [DPG Registry](http://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/). This multi-stakeholder initiative, endorsed by the United Nations Secretary-General and consisting of organizations such as UNICEF, iSPIRT, the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad), and the Government of Sierra Leone, aims to create a more equitable world by promoting digital public goods that embody open-source principles and address global challenges.

In recognizing PolicyEngine as a DPG, the DPGA affirms that we meet the [DPG Standard](http://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/): open-source software, open data, open AI models, open standards, and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm, and help attain the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In particular, the DPGA affirmed our view that PolicyEngine’s free, open source tax-benefit microsimulation software enables policymakers, researchers, and organizations to analyze and develop effective policies for addressing:

- [SDG1:](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal1) End poverty in all its forms everywhere

- [SDG5:](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal5) Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls

- [SDG8:](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8) Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all

- [SDG10:](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10) Reduce inequality within and among countries

While PolicyEngine originated in the UK and has grown to the US, we are also developing models in Canada and Nigeria, and we intend to expand to more countries in the future, especially those where the SDGs carry the greatest importance. We are honored to join the esteemed registry of organizations contributing to a global effort to improve policy development and create a more equitable and sustainable world.
