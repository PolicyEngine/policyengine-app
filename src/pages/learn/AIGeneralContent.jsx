            <h3>Machine learning foundations: 2021-2022</h3>
            <p>
              PolicyEngine has leveraged artificial intelligence since our
              inception. In 2021, we pioneered the use of machine learning to
              enhance our microsimulation models, applying gradient descent to{" "}
              {optimized} survey weights and match administrative totals with
              unprecedented accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
              By 2022, our UK model had achieved up to 80% lower aggregate
              errors compared to other microsimulation models. This foundation
              of AI-enhanced accuracy has been central to our mission of
              providing reliable policy analysis.
            </p>

            <h3>Data science innovation: 2023</h3>
            <p>
              We expanded our AI capabilities in 2023 with our Enhanced Current
              Population Survey (ECPS) for the US model, using quantile
              regression forests to integrate tax record information with survey
              data, creating the first open alternative to restricted tax
              microdata for policy microsimulation.
            </p>

            <h3>AI-Powered Analysis: 2023-Present</h3>
            <p>
              When OpenAI released GPT-4 in March 2023, we immediately{" "}
              {recognized} its potential to {democratize} policy understanding.
              Within just one month, we launched our AI-powered Analysis tool
              that translates complex computational results into accessible
              narratives.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2024, we extended this capability to household-level
              calculations with Anthropic&apos;s Claude API, enabling users to
              understand exactly how their taxes and benefits are calculated
              through plain-language explanations.

            <div className="how-it-works-text">
              <p>
                PolicyEngine integrates large language models with our
                computational tax-benefit engine to transform complex
                calculations into clear explanations.
              </p>
              <p>
                For household calculations, we process thousands of intermediate
                values across tax and benefit programs, then use
                Anthropic&apos;s Claude API to generate plain-language
                explanations of eligibility, amounts, and potential changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                For policy analysis, we leverage GPT-4 to weave narratives from
                our computational results, explaining reforms in terms anyone
                can understand - from simplified &quot;ELI5&quot; explanations
                to detailed technical analyses for policy experts.
