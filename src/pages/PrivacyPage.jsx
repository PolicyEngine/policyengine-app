      <h3>How does PolicyEngine use my data?</h3>
      <p>
        PolicyEngine does not store personally identifiable information. We{" "}
        <b>do</b> use Google Analytics to track site usage statistics using
        cookies. You can opt-out of this tracking by clicking the
        &quot;Necessary cookies only&quot; button on the cookie consent banner
        at the bottom of the page, in line with the General Data Protection
        Regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes external websites embed PolicyEngine-developed applications on
        their own pages as interactives. In these cases, the external website
        may on the same page collect data about your use of the PolicyEngine
        application: see their own privacy policy for details.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you create a household or policy reform, PolicyEngine stores an
        anonymous ID for it in the page URL: this is to enable you to refresh
        the page or share a link directly to a specific result without having to
        enter details again.
      </p>
