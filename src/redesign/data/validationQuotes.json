Its ability to process complex data and turn it into policy outcomes brings clarity and direction to policies at a stroke. An amazing tool that should be used in all discussions about policy in the future.",

To have democratic conversations about tax and benefits we need to look the overall picture and see what policies will mean for individuals and families. PolicyEngine pulls back the curtain on tax and benefits and helps us find the courage to introduce real reforms.",
