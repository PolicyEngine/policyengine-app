      longQuote: `It's difficult to overstate just how useful PolicyEngine has been in allowing the Green Party to fully assess its policy platform. Being able to measure fiscal balance, alongside the social and economic impacts of our key policies has given us a 3 dimensional mechanism to create, amend and connect policy in a way that simply was not possible before.

        \nThere is still much for us to do present a full picture of our proposals to policy makers and voters alike, but PolicyEngine's ability to show the consequences of policy in terms of household incomes, poverty rates and rates of inequality will help us get there very soon.
        
        \nSo far, it has been used to inform internal policy making and messaging, but we are hoping to go further and use it to demonstrate to voters exactly what our policy agenda can do to them.
        
        \nI can't praise PolicyEngine highly enough. It takes a lot of very complex data around a wide range of interconnected policies and turns it in to a simple, clear measure of real world outcomes. That data can and should drive much more detailed and effective policy discussions in the future, both within the Green Party and beyond.`,
