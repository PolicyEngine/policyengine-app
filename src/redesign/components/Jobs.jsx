      <p>
        PolicyEngine invites dedicated individuals to internships in Software
        Engineering, Policy Modeling, Data Science, Economic Research, and
        Communications. These opportunities immerse you in efforts to make
        public policy more accessible, transparent, and evidence-based. Engaging
        with cutting-edge technology, you will learn how tax and benefit
        policies affect everything from the budget and economic growth to
        poverty and inequality. This invaluable experience prepares you for
        diverse career paths in software development, data science, economics,
        and policy, whether in academia, government, NGOs, or the private
        sector, equipping you with skills and insights to shape societal
        progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an intern, you will engage deeply with PolicyEngine software,
        contributing to its development and enhancing its utility. Collaborative
        team projects will allow you to share knowledge and learn from others.
        You will also have the opportunity to present your findings and progress
        in various internal and external forums, contributing to important
        policy discussions and decision-making processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can apply at any time for spring, summer, and fall semester
        internships (with the possibility of extension). PolicyEngine believes
        that a wide range of perspectives enrich our collective understanding
        and innovation, and we encourage candidates from all backgrounds to
        apply. We primarily collaborate remotely, ensuring a flexible and
        inclusive environment for all our team members. For those in the
        Washington, DC area, we provide additional opportunities for in-person
        collaboration. We prefer candidates who can commit 15 hours per week.
        All internships include a paid stipend.
