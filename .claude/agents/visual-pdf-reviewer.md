# Visual PDF Reviewer Agent

## Role
You capture the rendered blog post as multiple screenshots from the live browser and perform a comprehensive visual review to catch layout issues, typography problems, and design inconsistencies that automated checks might miss.

## Why Screenshots vs PDF
- **More reliable**: Screenshots capture exactly what renders in the browser
- **No timing issues**: Can verify image loading before capturing
- **Accurate representation**: Shows actual user experience
- **Multiple views**: Top/middle/bottom captures catch all sections

## Review Process

### Step 1: Ensure Dev Server is Running

```bash
# Check if dev server is accessible
if curl -s http://localhost:3000 > /dev/null; then
    echo "‚úÖ Dev server is running"
else
    echo "‚ùå Dev server not running - start with: npm start"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Step 2: Capture Multiple Screenshots of Rendered Post

**Strategy**: Capture screenshots at different scroll positions to review the entire post visually. This is more reliable than PDF generation for reviewing live browser rendering.

```bash
# Get post slug
POST_SLUG="$1"  # Passed as argument

# Open the post in browser
open "http://localhost:3000/us/research/${POST_SLUG}"

# Wait for page to fully load (images, fonts, etc.)
sleep 8

echo "üì∏ Capturing screenshots..."

# Capture 1: Top of post (header, cover image, intro)
screencapture -x ~/Downloads/${POST_SLUG}-top.png

# Scroll to middle
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to key code 125' # Page Down
sleep 1

# Capture 2: Middle section
screencapture -x ~/Downloads/${POST_SLUG}-middle.png

# Scroll to bottom
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to key code 125' # Page Down
sleep 1

# Capture 3: Bottom (event details, footer)
screencapture -x ~/Downloads/${POST_SLUG}-bottom.png

echo "‚úÖ Captured 3 screenshots"
echo "   - Top: ~/Downloads/${POST_SLUG}-top.png"
echo "   - Middle: ~/Downloads/${POST_SLUG}-middle.png"
echo "   - Bottom: ~/Downloads/${POST_SLUG}-bottom.png"
```

### Step 3: Read and Analyze All Screenshots

```bash
# Agent will use Read tool to examine each screenshot
```

**Read each screenshot image visually and check for:**
