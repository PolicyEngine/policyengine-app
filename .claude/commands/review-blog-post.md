# Reviewing Blog Post: $ARGUMENTS

This command orchestrates all blog post QA agents to comprehensively review a post before publishing.

## Step 1: Identify the Post

```bash
# If argument provided, find that post
if [ -n "$ARGUMENTS" ]; then
    POST_SLUG="$ARGUMENTS"
else
    # Otherwise use the first post in posts.json
    POST_SLUG=$(jq -r '.[0].filename' src/posts/posts.json | sed 's/.md$//')
fi

echo "Reviewing post: $POST_SLUG"
```

## Step 2: Run All QA Agents

### Agent 1: blog-post-reviewer
**Checks**:
- Description length < 160 chars
- Images exist in correct location
- No duplicate metadata in markdown
- Country tag included
- posts.json formatting

**Invoke**: blog-post-reviewer agent with post slug

### Agent 2: writing-style-checker
**Checks**:
- Active voice usage
- No unsupported adjectives
- Neutral language (for policy posts)
- Sentence case headers
- Data precision

**Invoke**: writing-style-checker agent with post slug

### Agent 3: visual-qa-checker
**Checks**:
- Image optimization (< 500KB)
- Cover image aspect ratio
- Alt text on all images
- Social preview simulation

**Invoke**: visual-qa-checker agent with post slug

### Agent 4: visual-pdf-reviewer
**Checks**:
- Capture post as PDF/screenshot
- Visual layout quality
- Typography and readability
- Image rendering
- Event details formatting
- Overall design consistency

**Invoke**: visual-pdf-reviewer agent with post slug

## Step 3: Aggregate Results

**Collect issues from all agents**:

```markdown
## Comprehensive Blog Post Review: [POST_SLUG]

### Summary
- Total issues found: X
- Critical issues: X
- Warnings: X
- Suggestions: X

### blog-post-reviewer Results
[Insert agent 1 findings]

### writing-style-checker Results
[Insert agent 2 findings]

### visual-qa-checker Results
[Insert agent 3 findings]

### visual-pdf-reviewer Results
[Insert agent 4 findings - includes visual review of PDF/screenshot]

### Overall Status
[READY TO PUBLISH / CHANGES NEEDED / BLOCKED]
```

## Step 4: Generate Screenshot Preview

```bash
# Ensure dev server is running
if ! curl -s http://localhost:3000 > /dev/null; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Dev server not running. Start with: npm start"
else
    # Open the post
    open http://localhost:3000/us/research/$POST_SLUG

    # Wait for page to load
    sleep 3

    # Capture screenshots
    echo "üì∏ Taking screenshots..."

    # Desktop view - full page
    screencapture -w ~/Downloads/${POST_SLUG}-desktop.png

    # Social preview card simulation
    # (would need to screenshot the card preview specifically)
fi
```

## Common Issues to Check For

### From DC Office Post Experience

1. **Browser UI in screenshots**
   - Issue: Screenshot included URL bar
   - Fix: Crop top portion using Python PIL
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   from PIL import Image
   img = Image.open('public/images/posts/screenshot.png')
   cropped = img.crop((0, 140, img.width, img.height))  # Adjust 140 as needed
   cropped.save('public/images/posts/screenshot.png')
   "
   ```

2. **Description too long**
   - Issue: 227 characters
   - Fix: Trim to ~144 chars while keeping key points
   - Pattern: "We [action]. The result: [outcome]. Join us [CTA]!"

3. **Wrong image directory**
   - Issue: Images in src/images/posts/
   - Fix: Move to public/images/posts/
   ```bash
   mv src/images/posts/[image] public/images/posts/[image]
   ```

4. **Event formatting**
   - Issue: When and Where on same line
   - Fix: Add blank line between them

5. **Missing links**
   - Issue: Open Gov Hub not linked
   - Fix: Add links to organizations/tools mentioned

6. **Featured tag**
   - Issue: Blog post tagged as "featured"
   - Fix: Remove "featured" for internal/org posts
