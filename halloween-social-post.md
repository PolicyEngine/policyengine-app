## Option 1: Candy Tax Edition
The real horror story: your kid's trick-or-treat haul faces a 100% marginal tax rate when you "check for safety" ðŸŽƒ

At least with PolicyEngine, you can model tax policy changes that are actually transparent.

## Option 2: Evidence-Based Spooks
Ghosts and goblins? Not scary.

Zombies? Please.

Making billion-dollar policy decisions based on vibes instead of microsimulation? *Terrifying.* ðŸ‘»

## Option 3: Redistribution Joke
This Halloween, remember: taking candy from babies has a 0% approval rating, but optimal redistribution policy is still an open question.

Model the evidence at policyengine.org ðŸŽƒ

## Option 4: Universal Basic Candy
Proposed reform: Universal Basic Candy (UBC)

- Replaces current trick-or-treat system
- Means-tested by costume quality

Model it yourself: [link] ðŸ‘»

## Option 5: Short & Punchy
Your Halloween candy distribution strategy: vibes-based

Your tax policy: hopefully not
